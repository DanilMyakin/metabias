Hey, let us  talk about media & information.
<br><br>
News outlets are receiving a lot of hate recently, and not for a lack of reason. 
<br><br>
Everybody is trying to push their agenda. VCs shilling for their company, Lobbyist, Left, Right, Pro-Bitcoin, Pro-Gold, Russians, Chinese, EVERYBODY has an agenda.
<br><br>
What about complex topics, expert opinions? They are biased too.
<br><br>
Twitter, Facebook, YouTube’s main KPI is the number of eyeballs on the screen. They will feed you with information you already like and watch most, creating your personal echo-chamber.
<br><br>
Now let us think about the amount of information we deal with. By 2025, it’s estimated that 463 exabytes of data will be created each day globally.
<br><br>
With every major company having access to advanced NLP & Ai tools is using them to hook you up and make you scroll this timeline the whole day. How are we going to navigate through all of that? 
<br><br>
It is true that  information is essential to our development, both professionally and personally.<br>
It is also true that we need different opinions to make sound decisions. We need to include different parties to the dialogue. We need to see the full picture, not a part of it.
<br><br>
So what options do we have? How can we achieve this?
<br><br>
Thanks to technology advancements and communities like ods.ai, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is becoming more accessible than ever. Now we can use it to serve the bright side.
<br><br>
With blockchain, it became easier to use the crowd's wisdom and organize people in a decentralized fashion.
<br><br>
Our vision is to make information reliable and easy to consume. And that is why we created Meta///Bias.
<br><br>
We are releasing our Web-Platform this year and invite you to join us on this journey.
