    It feels like everybody is just shilling their ideas, investments, projects, leaving no room for a healthy discussion. Alienating other opinions.
<br><br>
We got tired of biased media. We got tired of BS.
<br><br>
<b>MetaBias</b> is our answer to the problem. 
<br><br>
Our goal is to invite different sides to participate in the discussion, while making it clear, who they do represent.
<br><br>
Our goal is to give voice to people, who want to be heard. To give voice to general users and the broad community.
<br><br>
Our goal is to make the process of information consumption easy and quick.
<br><br>
Leveraging the latest developments in NLP to analyze data from the crypto-universe we are going to aggregate all important news, texts, and opinions in one place.
<br><br>
Incorporating different ratings we will enrich our dataset and further enhance the reliability of our models while giving our users voice.
